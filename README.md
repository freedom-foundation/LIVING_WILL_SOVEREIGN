Note: The filesystem times are in loose chronological order and do not coincide exactly with document creation or release times. It would be nice to correct the FS dates.

TO-DO: correct the FS dates - begin to copy all of the files to a mandated file using development mode as described in [filename_conventions](https://github.com/freedom-foundation/LIVING_WILL_SOVEREIGN/blob/d36ccea3b88d17a48997a4fd5030ac06d16c87d0/filename_conventions.md).

Roadmap: I have plans for biometrics, a fingerprint box near the signature.

Log: I began a very complex process of translating the document. I found all automated translation software to be lacking and began to think myself in more languages the only finished translation in Greek was lost due to data loss. Some of my translation progress I saved as Translator's notes. Translation has been put on hold. 

Commentary - I wrote a commantary to explain how My English is used so there is no misunderstanding. The entire directive is contained in the commentary and every line is explained.

Google Edition - is the terms I used for the document having been edited in Google Docs although I have ceased to use Google because of espionage and privacy issues. 

Digital Edition - abbreviate DE The purpose of this is to have a electronic stored texts edition, an application made for easy use although I have some qualms about calling electronic documents "digital" as the data is neither a number nor counted on fingers. 

LWS - an abbreviation for Living Will Sovereign was used while editing in Termux or the Termux Edition.

LWS.bin LWS.hex LWS.oct - This is a sort of backup sprawl to preserve the integrity of the document in three forms of encoding .bin, .hex, and .oct fully called binary, hexidecimal, and octal.
